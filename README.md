# IL2CPP-DirectX-ImGui-Base
This base is for modifying IL2CPP based Unity games very easily.

Smooth codes, no code junk, no mess, everything stored in the right place.

This cheat base inspired by Idol: https://github.com/IdolTheDev/Il2CPP-Base

Since Idol's base is messy, and I don't like working in those bases, I rewrote everything.

For this project u need to install vcpkg.
With vcpkg install the static minhook x64 window library, just like this: "vcpkg install minhook:x64-windows-static"

Please set the project to Release | x64, and ready to go.

Structure:
- Folder\Build\Platform\Your Dll
- Folder\Intermediate\Platform\Your Files
